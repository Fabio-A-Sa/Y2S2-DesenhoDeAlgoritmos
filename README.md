## Here are several documents, namely:

### My Drafts <br/>
Pieces of code for exercises and assessments, notes that I take during practical classes and other experiences using C and C++ languages. It is an authentic disorganized notebook. <br>

### Notes
Notes that I take during theoretical lectures, in Cpp files or Markdown <br>

### Exercises
Varied exercises of easy, medium and difficult level, about the subject taught in the present week. They complement the weekly work developed during the practical classes. <br>

### Project 1 - Urban Logistics for Packages Delivery (Grade: 18.5/20)

A delivery company wants to see its business maximized according to the following scenarios:

- Optimization of the number of couriers;
- Optimization of the company's profit bgity delivering orders using lower cost vans;
- Optimization of express deliveries, improving average delivery time;

The following project implements solutions for each of the cases using some studied algorithms, such as greedy, bin-packing, knapsack and job scheduling. <br>
